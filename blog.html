                <h3>The Meaning</h3>
                <p>Music is more than a multibillion industry. Artists have for long
                    struggled with
                    making a living of
                    something so profound as music. This art-form is as important for us as the
                    food we eat, the air we breath and the social interactions we have.

                            Music is the art of arranging sounds in time to produce a composition through the elements
                            of
                            melody, harmony, rhyhthm and timbre </blockquote></em>

                <p>
                    That is the official description of what music is, but what does it mean for us as humans in daily
                    life. What role does music play for the intrinsic growth and what affect does music have on our
                    wellbeing?
                </p>

                <h3>The Musical Effects on Our Mental Health</h3>
                <p>Below are five areas within mental health of which music has a proven effect. Presented by
                    <a class="underline-link"
                        href="https://www.openminds.org.au/news/5-positive-effects-music-mental-health">Openminds.org</a>

                </p>
                <h4>Mood & Motivation</h4>
                <p>A strong mental wellbeing is closely aligned with optimistic and positive
                    feelings.
                    So, when you‚Äôre having a bad day, there‚Äôs nothing better than playing an uplifting and joyous song
                    as loud as you can.
                    The bright musical tones and lyrics will change or elevate your mood and empower you for the day
                    ahead.
                    Slow start to the morning? Need to get through a long day of week? No motivation to go for a run?
                    Up-tempo, fast-paced music gets your brain and body moving, making you amped up and motivated to
                    enjoy what‚Äôs ahead.
                    In fact, researchers have claimed classical and ambient music have the best mood-boosting benefits,
                    while metal and hard electronic music were considered to have the opposite effect.
                </p>
                <h4>Stress Reduction</h4>
                <p>Music‚Äôs ability to be a stress reliever should not be downplayed.
                    Whether playing in the background or you‚Äôre giving it your full attention, certain genres of music
                    have the innate ability to reduce stress.
                    Soft, ambient music provides calming stimulation for the mind. In this case, best avoid loud rock or
                    metal to moderate your stress.
                    If you‚Äôre looking to wash away some stress, search for playlists that contain a lot of ambient and
                    quiet music.</p>
                <h4>Focus Improver</h4>
                <p>One of many great benefits of music is that it can used while you perform your everyday activities.

                    Trying to stay focussed and concentrate on an activity‚Äîwhether that be studying, working or
                    cleaning‚Äîcan be difficult for some.

                    Certain types of music are known to boost focus, so it‚Äôs important to know which music is right for
                    improving focus.

                    We recommend listening to instrumental, classical or ambient music.</p>
                <h4>Relaxation</h4>
                <p>Everyone enjoys relaxing and switching off their mind at the end of a long day.

                    <u> <b>
                            Playing music is a simple way of promoting relaxation as it releases tension in your
                            muscles,
                            carrying away any stress or anxiety. </u> </b>

                    When your muscles are loose, so is your mind.

                    Listening to music as you drift off to sleep is also an effective way of relaxing and reducing
                    stress as it can help slow your breathing and calm your mind.
                </p>
                <h4>Anxiety & Depression</h4>
                <p>Understanding how music affects your emotions goes a long way to help ease anxious and depressive
                    thoughts.

                    Music Therapy has become a popular form of treating anxiety and depression.

                    It‚Äôs an exercise in listening and composing therapeutic music to promote physical and mental
                    rehabilitation.
                    In fact, a recent study by Dr. David Lewis-Hodgson of <a
                        href="https://www.notion.so/The-meaning-of-music-4e472a93a93841c985df01d098ddfc84#7a28c091e4444f6fa3148c59131f33be">Mindlab
                        International</a> has shown instrumental, classical or ambient music can help reduce anxiety by
                    up to 65%.</p>
                <h3>Brain stimulation when playing music</h3>
                <p>It is more or less common knowledge nowadays that physical exercise helps us <a
